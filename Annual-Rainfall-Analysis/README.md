# 🌧️ Annual Rainfall Data Regression Project

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Regression Modeling** of the **Annual Rainfall Dataset (1901–2015)**, aiming to uncover rainfall trends and build predictive models for better climatic insights.  

---

## 📝 Project Overview
- Collected and analyzed **annual rainfall data (1901–2015)** with multiple features.  
- Identified **seasonal rainfall distribution** and yearly variation.  
- Applied **data preprocessing** (handling missing values, encoding, scaling).  
- Visualized rainfall trends using **histograms, boxplots, and line plots**.  
- Built and evaluated a **Linear Regression model** to predict rainfall.  

---

## 🔑 Key Insights
- Rainfall patterns show strong **seasonal variation** across years.  
- Certain years experienced **extreme rainfall deviations** (droughts/floods).  
- **Feature scaling** improved regression model accuracy.  
- The regression model provides a **baseline prediction**, but can be enhanced with advanced ML models.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Regression & Evaluation)  
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook** (Execution Environment)
