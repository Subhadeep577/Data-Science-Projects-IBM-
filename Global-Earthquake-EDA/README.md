# 🌍 Global Earthquake EDA

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the **Global Earthquake Dataset**, aiming to uncover patterns in seismic activity across the globe.

## 📌 Project Overview
- Identified top earthquake-prone regions and countries.
- Analyzed frequency distribution, magnitude, and depth trends.
- Examined depth vs. magnitude relationships.
- Mapped spatial and temporal earthquake distribution using **heatmaps** and **line plots**.
- Investigated data source contributions like **USGS**.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- High frequency of earthquakes in regions like **Alaska, Indonesia, and Japan**.
- Most earthquakes are of lower intensity (< 5.0), but some deep events still reach high magnitudes.
- Deeper earthquakes are less frequent but can be intense.
- Reliable data sources improve seismic risk mapping.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **Folium** (Geospatial Mapping)
- **Plotly** (Interactive Visuals)

## 📊 Visuals
- Heatmaps of seismic hotspots
- Scatter plots for depth vs. magnitude
- Temporal earthquake trends
